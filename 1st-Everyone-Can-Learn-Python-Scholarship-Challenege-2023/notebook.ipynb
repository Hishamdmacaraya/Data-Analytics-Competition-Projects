Challenge - CO2 Emissions\n\n\n## Background\nYou volunteer for a public policy advocacy organization in Canada, and your colleague asked you to help her draft recommendations for guidelines on CO2 emissions rules. \n\nAfter researching emissions data for a wide range of Canadian vehicles, she would like you to investigate which vehicles produce lower emissions.\n\n## The data\n\n### Seven years of CO2 emissions data for Canadian vehicles ([source](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64#wb-auto-6)):\n\n- \"Make\" - The company that manufactures the vehicle.\n- \"Model\" - The vehicle's model.\n- \"Vehicle Class\" - Vehicle class by utility, capacity, and weight.\n- \"Engine Size(L)\" - The engine's displacement in liters.\n- \"Cylinders\" - The number of cylinders.\n- \"Transmission\" - The transmission type: A = Automatic, AM = Automatic Manual, AS = Automatic with select shift, AV = Continuously variable, M = Manual, 3 - 10 = the number of gears.\n- \"Fuel Type\" - The fuel type: X = Regular gasoline, Z = Premium gasoline, D = Diesel, E = Ethanol (E85), N = natural gas.\n- \"Fuel Consumption Comb (L/100 km)\" - Combined city/highway (55%/45%) fuel consumption in liters per 100 km (L/100 km).\n- \"CO2 Emissions(g/km)\" - The tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions in grams per kilometer for combined city and highway driving. \n\nThe data comes from the Government of Canada's open data [website](https://open.canada.ca/en).","metadata":{},"id":"237b1c84-c993-47dc-ac53-512c903e0c59","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"#Import the

One of the key insights is that the least fuel-efficient gas type in the dataset is Ethanol, with an average fuel consumption of 16.86 L/100 km. This is significantly higher than the average fuel consumption for regular gasoline (X), which is 11.95 L/100 km, and premium gasoline (Z), which is 11.26 L/100 km. Diesel (D) has the lowest fuel consumption with an average of 8.19 L/100 km. The spread of fuel consumption for Ethanol is also quite wide, with the highest consumption being 23.08 L/100 km and the lowest being 9.9 L/100 km.\n\nSurprisingly, Ethanol also has the highest CO2 emission in the dataset, with an average of 264.5 g/km. This is in contrast to the common assumption that Ethanol is good for the environment, as it is often considered a \"green\" fuel due to its renewable nature. Further research and evidence are needed to investigate this finding and to determine the reasons behind it.\n\nIn addition to the fuel consumption and CO2 emission insights, the analysis also revealed that the average CO2 emission of all fuel types is 250.58 g/km. Interestingly, the average CO2 emission for fuel types X, Z, E, and D is only slightly higher at 252.28 g/km. This indicates that the fuel type may not be the only factor affecting CO2 emissions, and other factors such as the engine size, driving behavior, and vehicle weight may also play a significant role.\n\nOverall, these insights highlight the importance of considering various factors when evaluating the environmental impact of different fuel types and vehicles. Further research and analysis may be needed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between fuel consumption, CO2 emissions, and other factors affecting the environment.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"d294350b-f57f-4cad-a4a1-f36a5b363a04"},{"source":"print('Insight #2')\nprint()\n\n#Prompt\nprint('What is the average fuel consumption for regular gasoline (Fuel Type = X), premium gasoline (Z), ethanol (E), and diesel (D)?')\nprint('The average fuel consumption of fuel types X, Z, E, and D are shown in the middle column of the table bellow.

Specifically, bikes from the 2019 model year have an average list price of \\$2583.32, which is higher than bikes from the 2018 and 2017 model years, with average list prices of \\$1658.47 and \\$1279.93, respectively.\n\nThis suggests that the customers of the bicycle store highly value having the latest technology and features in their bikes, and are willing to pay more for these benefits. Thus, highlighting the features and improvements of newer model year bikes in the store's marketing and sales efforts could potentially lead to increased sales.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that this trend may not apply to all types of bikes or customer segments. Some customers may prioritize price or specific features over having the latest model year, so the store may need to tailor their marketing and product offerings accordingly to maximize sales and customer satisfaction.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6e6f6ea9-ef01-4e37-86f2-a63199073d33"},{"source":"SELECT model_year, AVG(list_price) AS avg_price\nFROM products\nGROUP BY model_year\nORDER BY model_year DESC","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"df","sqlSource":{"integrationId":"3b99a52b-51d6-49a4-b2fd-4ca490fb4f4b","type":"integration"},"executionCancelledAt":1679214334607},"cell_type":"code","id":"db710170-1ae5-4051-bb7d-60d6559cd2c2","execution_count":97,"outputs":[]},{"source":"### For Reference, here the 3 tables joined together.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"785dce1d-0da1-469a-ac38-acb88dda9966"},{"source":"SELECT *\nFROM products AS p\nFULL JOIN categories AS c\nON p.category_id = c.category_id\nFULL JOIN brands AS b\nON p.brand_id = b.brand_id\n","metadata":{"customType":"sql","dataFrameVariableName":"df","initial":false,"integrationId":"3b99a52b-51d6-49a4-b2fd-4ca490fb4f4b","visualizeDataframe":false,"chartConfig":{"bar":{"hasRoundedCorners":true,"stacked":false},"type":"bar","version":"v1"},"executionCancelledAt":1679214334620},"cell_type":"code","id":"566b647a-eeec-409f-84e0-de95d76a29a3","execution_count":93,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"editor":"DataCamp Workspace","kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
